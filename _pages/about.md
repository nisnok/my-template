Hello all ! I'm Nisha. I've always wondered about living in a world full of challenges, but I managed to somehow reduce my stress a bit,thanks to the multiple hobbies I have. I've tried multiple extra curriculars like swimming, table tennis, music and badminton. But my ability to sing is a bit superior. I stood fourth in a national level competition held in Pune and was invited to many international places like Dubai and Thailand for further rounds. I have always managed studies and music for a long time in my school years.

I majored in computer science from Mumbai University.I have interned in LTI for 3 months . Now,I am a full-time employee as a data engineer in the same company. I have a lot of interest in databases, data warehousing and building AI models for increasing efficiency. Please visit the other sections for more details about me.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
